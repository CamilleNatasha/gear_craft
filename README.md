# GearCraft – Modular In-Game Item System with Xsolla ZK

GearCraft is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Xsolla ZK stack that allows players to **craft, upgrade, and trade modular in-game items**. These items are represented using:

- 🎮 **ERC721** for unique gear
- 🧱 **ERC1155** for stackable components (blades, hilts, cores)
- 🧠 **EIP4626** for yield-generating item staking mechanics

### Why GearCraft?
It has an immersive and rewarding Web3 gaming experience where crafting decisions are meaningful, gear is composable, and every weapon tells a story.
